# AutoDoc
A medical ontology

The purpose of this ontology is to infer what diseases a person might have based on available information about their symptoms, blood tests they have taken, and other personal details (height, weight, age). In a way, this ontology functions as an automated doctor, diagnosing patients based on their symptoms and medical history.
Another point of interest is that the ontology also takes into account whether or not two patients have been in the same environment, or have had close contact or are related to each other. This helps to discover the risks one patient might be at, by considering common factors between them and other patients. 
For instance, if patient A works at place P and is diagnosed with cadmium poisoning, then there is a high possibility that patient B who also works at place P, is exposed to cadmium. Also, if patient C is diagnosed with disease D, which is hereditary, and has a blood relative patient D, then there is a high possibility that patient D is at risk for that disease.
